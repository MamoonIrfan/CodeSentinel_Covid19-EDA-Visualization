# COVID-19 EDA & Visualization

This repository contains Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on a **COVID-19 country-wise dataset**.  
We used **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** to explore, clean, and visualize the data.

2. **Top 5 Most Frequent Values**
   - Extracted most frequent values from categorical columns like:
     - `Country/Region`
     - `WHO Region`

3. **Distribution Plots (Histograms & Boxplots)**
   - Plotted histograms to show value distributions.
   - Boxplots to detect outliers and spread in data.
